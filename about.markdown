The site is constructed with support of github pages. The site gives a brief introduction about my 
projects, and you will find the source codes for most of them at my [github](https://github.com/lee-vius/). Besides some interesting projects I have done in the past years, I will post blogs on topics I am or will be learning, serving as study notes. If you find problems or you might get interested in the content, feel free to contact me through e-mail, which is shown at bottom of the site.
